# 🎯 Topic: Reading Files & Word Frequency Counter

## Today’s challenge was all about working with files and real-world text data. 

I took on a classic task:
 🔍 Counting word frequency in a text file using Python.

Here’s what I tackled today:
✅ Read a .txt file using Python
 ✅ Split the content into words
 ✅ Normalized the text (lowercased and removed punctuation)
 ✅ Used a dictionary to count how many times each word appears
